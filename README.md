# SmartStyle - Salon Management System ^-^

This project is based on a real business stationed in Tirana, Albania and will provide them with a Management System of a Spa and Hairdresser salon. 

A Spa and Hairdresser salon management system is what we plan to design and implement especially for this business. The system is thought to keep track of all the activities that are carried on a daily basis within the salon. It maintains stock of inventory coming in and going out (hopefully). It will also manage individual employee salary. The system is even equipped to manage customer billing and data storage, with a nice retouch to show a special bonus to each client on theri special day. This fully equipped system alone will be able to manage the entire operation of a spa and hairdresser salon, including the accouting prospect on a basic level.
