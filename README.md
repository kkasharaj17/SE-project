# SmartStyle - Salon Management System ^-^

This project is based on a real business stationed in Tirana, Albania and will provide them with a Management System of a Spa and Hairdresser salon. 

A Spa and Hairdresser salon management system is what we plan to design and implement especially for this business. It will provide valuable tools to simplify management of different operations.The system is thought to keep track of all the activities that are carried out on a daily basis within the salon. It maintains stock of inventory coming in and going out (hopefully). Another feature is management of individual employee salary. The system is even equipped to manage customer billing and data storage, with a nice retouch to show a special bonus reminder to each client on their special day. 
SmartStyle will help improve your scheduling process by managing client appointments and regulating staff members' availability which will be trasparent to the customer.
This fully equipped system alone will be able to manage the entire operations of a spa and hairdresser salon, including the accounting prospect on a basic level.
